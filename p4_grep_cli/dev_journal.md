This book is amazing. I'm blown away how well written and thoughtful it is when considering the audience likely has never made a CLI or even made a Rust program. I need to read ch 1.6 again to execute the tests that are recommended as well as segregate the code into a library. These are two things that I often neglect since I have never done either and I'm uncomfortable with them.

It looks like an actual CLI now, which feels great. I just need to add some logic to have it perform an action. Suddenly, it feels like I could make something like this and then implement it with Eww. A very cool idea.

I realized that making little apps that do basic math or conversions is interesting but more for learning and less for function. Having the basic understanding about how to make a CLI would be a better approach. I can then make things that I think I need. Like, recently I realized I don't have a calculator and I know Rofi has a calculator plugin but I think I can make this myself... Though, I think the terminal can do it anyway... lol.
